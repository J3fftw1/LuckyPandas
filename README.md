# LuckyPandas

This plugin was first of based of the addon [Luckyblocks](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/luckyblocks-sf/) for the plugin [Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4). 

This has been changed later on into a standalone plugin. 

As you all know, pandas are precious and should be protected at all costs. However, should you find your self in the unfortunate situation in which you must kill a panda(which is never), you'll now find each kill comes with a.... surprise.

What surprises? Well, you'll have to find out for yourself!

Some are good, some are bad - none will be worth the death of such majestic creatures, but that's on your conscience!
